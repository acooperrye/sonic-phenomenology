## THE CLAIM

This is not a metaphor. Music — the total human endeavour of making, hearing, and feeling organised sound — is a single living organism. It has a genome. The genome follows the same structural hierarchy as biological genomes, and the same evolutionary dynamics. The architecture that biology has spent a century formalising applies directly.

The value of this frame is analytical: it gives us a tested, falsifiable vocabulary for how conventions emerge, spread, saturate, become generic, get silenced, and reactivate. It answers the question "when does a genre convention become generic?" with the precision of population genetics rather than vibes.

## THE HIERARCHY

### The Organism: Music

One organism. Singular. Everything humans have ever made with intentional sound. It has been alive since the first human rhythm, and it grows continuously. It does not die unless its host species dies. It is closest in biology to a clonal colonial organism — a Pando, an aspen grove — continuously adding new growth, never shedding old growth, connected across time by a shared root system.

### The Genome: all songs, all recordings, all performances

The complete genetic material of the organism. It only grows. No chromosome is deleted from the genome — though chromosomes can be LOST (recordings destroyed, traditions broken — this is chromosomal deletion and it is pathological). The genome is an archaeological record. Everything that was ever successfully expressed is still in there, available for reactivation.

### Chromosomes: songs

A song is a chromosome. The discrete, packaged unit of genetic material. It travels as one thing. All the genes on it are linked — you can't inherit the drums without the bass, the verse without the chorus. Everything on a chromosome co-inherits because it is physically one object.

Songs come in stereo pairs — **diploid**. L and R are homologous chromosomes. They carry the same genes (the same musical content, the same frequency ranges, the same time spans) but with different alleles (different amplitudes, phases, timing). The M/S transform separates the **homozygous signal** (M — what's common to both copies) from the **heterozygous signal** (S — what differs between them). The M/S ratio is a **heterozygosity index**. Mono recordings are haploid. Surround-sound recordings are polyploid.

A genre has a lot more chromosomes than a human (23 pairs). A genre's karyotype might contain thousands or millions of song-chromosomes. But the genome is not growing by inventing new chromosomal types — genres keep showing **different expressions of known chromosomes**. The structural templates, the gene loci, the functional positions — these are ancient. What changes is which alleles occupy them.

### Genes: sonic elements and conventions within a song

A kick pattern is a gene. A bass line is a gene. A vocal melody is a gene. A specific reverb treatment is a gene. Each gene has a **locus** — a position on the chromosome defined by time and frequency within the song. Each gene codes for a functional product that the listener's perceptual machinery transcribes.

Genes can be:
- **Expressed** — audible, present in the mix at perceptible levels
- **Silenced** — present in the recording but masked, mixed below threshold, or cut
- **Dominant** — the element the listener consciously perceives at a given moment
- **Recessive** — present but not consciously tracked (background, texture, felt but not heard)

The masking matrix already in the system is a **dominance hierarchy** — which genes suppress the expression of other genes when they co-occur.

### Alleles: convention variants

Gated reverb and natural decay are alleles at the same locus on the "snare processing" gene. Pitched 808 and acoustic kick are alleles at the "low-end impact" locus. Auto-tune and natural pitch are alleles at the "vocal tuning" locus.

Each song-chromosome carries specific alleles at each locus. The genre's gene pool contains all alleles at all loci across all its chromosomes. Convention prevalence is **allele frequency** — the proportion of chromosomes in the genre's gene pool that carry a given allele.

In the system, this is the Convention struct's `entrenchment` field: a **signed float** where magnitude = frequency and sign = direction of travel. The convention's full lifecycle is recoverable from the algebra underneath, but the working value during analysis is the signed number evaluated at the song's production date.

## REGULATION > CONTENT

The single most important principle in the frame.

Humans and chimpanzees share ~98.7% of their DNA. The difference between species is not what genes they carry — it's which genes are expressed, when, where, and at what levels. Regulatory evolution produces more phenotypic diversity than new gene creation. The same gene expressed in the brain produces a different outcome than the same gene expressed in the liver — not because the gene changed, but because the expression context changed.

Music works the same way. The genes are ancient and known: rhythm, pitched sound, dynamics, timbre, repetition, tension-release, call-and-response. These have been in the genome since the first humans sang. What creates the staggering diversity of musical expression across cultures and across history is not new genes. It is new **regulation** of the same genes.

A kick drum is a gene. It's the same gene in a funk track, a techno track, and a breakcore track. What changed is:

- **Expression level** — how loud, how present in the mix. The mix is gene regulation.
- **Temporal regulation** — when in the song it's expressed. The arrangement is a promoter sequence.
- **Co-expression context** — what other genes are simultaneously active. The ensemble is the regulatory network.
- **Epigenetic state** — what cultural meaning has accumulated on this gene through its history of expression and silencing.

**A genre is not a species. A genre is a cell type.** Every cell in your body has the same DNA. A liver cell and a neuron are genetically identical. What makes them different is which genes are expressed and which are silenced — the **expression profile**. Jazz and punk have access to the same genome. What makes them different is which genes they express and at what levels. Same genome. Different cell type.

**Genre emergence is cellular differentiation** — the process during development where a stem cell commits to a specific expression programme and becomes specialised. A musical impulse differentiates into a genre when a consistent expression programme locks in: these alleles expressed, these silenced, this regulatory environment maintained.

### Alternative splicing: the remix

One gene can produce multiple different proteins through alternative splicing — the spliceosome decides which exons to keep and which introns to cut. Different splicing, same gene, completely different functional product.

A remix is alternative splicing. Same chromosomal material (the stems). The remix producer is the spliceosome. They decide: keep this exon (the vocal), cut this intron (the original drums), re-read this exon in a different frame (time-stretch, pitch-shift, rearrange). Same gene. Different protein. A jazz song becomes a dance track. The genotype didn't change. The splicing did.

This is why regulation > content is the foundational principle: you can change EVERYTHING about how a song sounds — its genre, its energy, its cultural meaning — without changing the underlying genetic material. All you change is the regulation.

### The regulatory apparatus

| Biological level | Musical equivalent | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Transcription (DNA → pre-mRNA) | The initial recording/arrangement | Selecting which genetic material to read |
| RNA splicing (pre-mRNA → mature mRNA) | The mix / the production decisions | Selecting which parts to include, at what levels |
| Alternative splicing | Remixing | Same source, different exon selection, different product |
| Translation (mRNA → protein) | Playback / the listening event | The processed signal becomes functional output |
| Post-translational modification | The room, the speakers, the listener's state | Modifying the product after synthesis |
| microRNA (silencing) | Cultural signals ("that's dated", "that's uncool") | Small regulatory molecules that suppress expression |
| RNA interference | Genre gatekeeping, scene policing, critical rejection | Active defence mechanisms against TE expression |
| Epigenetic marks (methylation) | Accumulated cultural meaning | Heritable marks that modify expression without changing sequence |
| Transcription factors | The mixing desk, the producer | Regulatory machinery that controls which genes are expressed |

## RECOMBINATION

How new chromosomes are produced from existing genetic material.

### Sampling = crossover / recombination

Taking a segment of one song-chromosome (a drum break, a vocal phrase, a bass line) and splicing it into a new song-chromosome. The sampler is the **recombinase enzyme**. The precision of the splice matters: a clean sample that sits well in its new context is a viable recombination event. A sample that clashes is a deleterious translocation.

The Amen break is a **recombination hotspot** — a chromosomal segment with unusually high viability across diverse genomic contexts. Its genes are robust to translocation. They maintain function when spliced into radically different chromosomal environments. That's why it's been sampled thousands of times — it has high recombinogenic potential.

### Remixing = meiosis

The producer receives the parental genome (stems/multitracks), separates the chromosomes (isolates tracks), performs crossover (keeps some, replaces others, splices between sources), and produces a new organism. The remix is the offspring.

### Covering = same genotype, different expression environment

Inheriting the entire chromosome but re-expressing all its genes through your own regulatory apparatus (your voice, your instruments, your production). The genotype is preserved. The phenotype changes because the expression context is different. Same genome in a different organism — identical twins raised in different environments.

### Interpolation = gene synthesis

Re-synthesising a segment rather than splicing the original. You don't take the physical gene — you reconstruct it from sequence information.

### DJing = hybridisation

Two chromosomes from different territories running in parallel, temporarily fused. The beatmatch is chromosome alignment — getting homologous regions to line up so the hybrid functions. When BPMs match and phrases align, the chromosomes have paired correctly.

## THE CONVENTION LIFECYCLE (Allele Frequency Dynamics)

The central question: when does a convention become generic? Answer: when an allele reaches fixation but carries no fitness advantage. It's a neutral allele at 100% frequency. Detecting it tells you nothing.

The lifecycle follows population genetics:

### Phase 1: Mutation

A new allele appears on a single chromosome. One song, one new gene variant. Frequency: 1/N (where N is the population of chromosomes in the relevant territory). The system can only detect this retrospectively.

### Phase 2: Transposition

The allele copies to other chromosomes — through sampling (Class I retrotransposon: copy-and-paste, original stays), through influence (horizontal gene transfer within the genome), through collaboration (gene flow via artist movement between territories).

Two classes:
- **Class I (copy-and-paste):** the original chromosome retains the gene AND copies appear elsewhere. The Amen break: exists in its original funk context AND in jungle AND DnB AND breakcore. It copied. The original didn't leave.
- **Class II (cut-and-paste):** the gene becomes so associated with its new context that it effectively excises from the original. The 303 arguably cut-and-pasted from "bass accompaniment tool" into "acid house" so completely that using a 303 "straight" now feels like a reference to acid.

### Phase 3: Polymorphism

The allele is at intermediate frequency. Some chromosomes in the territory carry it, some don't. Both are viable. The allele is "in play" — it carries information about artistic choices. This is the phase where the convention MEANS something: choosing to use it or not use it is a legible decision.

Duration: proportional to effective population size. Small scene (underground) = short polymorphic phase, fast fixation or loss. Large population (mainstream) = long polymorphic phase.

### Phase 4: Fixation

The allele reaches ~100% frequency in a territory. Its absence is now the marked case. Every chromosome in the genre carries it. It's expected. It's water. This is what the existing system captures as high `entrenchment`.

**Two pathways to fixation:**
- **Selection:** the allele confers fitness advantage (commercial success, critical acclaim, dancefloor response). S-curve trajectory. Rapid.
- **Drift:** in a small territory, the allele fixes randomly — not because it's better, but because the population is small enough that a few artists' choices dominate. Random walk trajectory. The sound of the underground is shaped by drift as much as selection.

### Phase 5: Selective sweep / hitchhiking

When a strongly selected allele fixes rapidly, it drags linked alleles along with it. Conventions physically close on the same chromosomes (co-occurring in the same influential songs) co-inherit even when there's no functional relationship between them. The gated drum dragged DX7 pads, synthetic bass, and specific reverb profiles to fixation — not because they worked well together, but because they were linked on the same influential chromosomes.

**This is a testable prediction:** conventions that co-occur on the same influential songs should co-inherit at higher rates than conventions on different songs, even without functional relationship. That's linkage. The system should look for it.

### Phase 6: Genericization (neutral fixation)

The allele is at 100% frequency but carries zero fitness advantage. It's a **housekeeping gene** — constitutively expressed, necessary for the cell to function ("necessary to sound current"), but carrying no tissue-specific information. Like actin in every human cell. The gated drum in 1987.

This is when convention becomes generic. Not when it's widespread — when it's widespread AND informationally empty. High frequency + zero information = generic.

### Phase 7: Negative selection / host defence

The allele begins to confer fitness disadvantage. Association with datedness, over-commercialisation, uncoolness. Frequency drops. In the organism, this manifests as **RNA interference** — active defence mechanisms that suppress the allele's expression. Genre gatekeeping, critical backlash, the cultural immune system saying "no more of this."

### Phase 8: Epigenetic silencing

The allele is driven below expression threshold but NOT deleted from the genome. Music remembers everything. The gene is methylated — present in the cultural memory (production manuals, sample libraries, collective knowledge) but actively suppressed. The 90s dry drum aesthetic is the methylation of the gated reverb gene.

### Phase 9: Reactivation

The silenced allele is de-methylated and re-expressed. Synthwave gated drums. Hyperpop auto-tune. But the reactivated gene carries its **epigenetic history** — the methylation marks, the memory of its previous lifecycle. A reactivated convention is not the same as a convention that was never silenced. It means something different the second time because its full biography is encoded in how it's used.

---

## THE THREE FORCES

These determine which direction allele frequencies move. Everything in the convention lifecycle is shaped by their interaction.

### Selection

Non-random survival based on fitness. In Music:
- **Positive selection:** commercial success, critical acclaim, dancefloor response, viral spread, somatic resonance. The allele makes chromosomes more fit.
- **Negative selection:** association with datedness, cringe, over-commercialisation. The allele reduces fitness.
- **Purifying selection:** genre gatekeeping, scene policing, critical rejection. Alleles that don't fit the territory's identity are purged.

### Drift

Random frequency change due to finite population size. Dominant in small scenes (underground, local, niche). Negligible in mainstream. The sound of the underground is shaped by drift — conventions fix or die not because they're good or bad but because the population is small enough that individual artists' choices dominate. This is why small scenes produce distinctive sounds that couldn't emerge in the mainstream: drift creates differentiation that selection would not.

### Gene flow

Movement of genetic material between territories via artist movement. A producer who worked in grime starts making pop; grime conventions flow into pop. Not the same as translocation (which is convention-level); gene flow is artist-level. An artist IS a vector of gene flow — they carry alleles from every territory they've inhabited.

## MAPPING TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM

The system was already doing genomics. This frame names what each component is.

### Binary Engine = Genome Sequencer

Reads a single chromosome (song). Identifies genes (sonic elements) at their loci (time × frequency positions). The 55 measurement elements are **gene annotations** — functional regions identified in the sequence. The SpectralRoster is **gene expression mapping** — which regions are actively producing functional output. HPSS separates two reading frames of the same sequence: harmonic (tonal information) and percussive (temporal structure).

### Web Engine = Environmental Survey

Maps the external conditions affecting gene expression. Cultural context, production credits, artist intent, critical reception. This is the **environment** in the Phenotype = Genotype + Environment equation. The Web Engine doesn't read the genome — it reads the world the genome is expressed in.

### Cultural Engine = Population Genetics Lab

Tracks allele frequencies across chromosome territories over time. The Convention Bank is a **gene frequency database**. The Fingerprint Registry is a **gene sequence catalogue**. The Genre-Fingerprint Map is a **tissue-specific expression atlas** — which genes are expressed in which cell type (genre).

**The `entrenchment` field is settled (11 Feb 2026).** It stays a float, but signed. The magnitude is the allele frequency (0.0–1.0). The sign is the direction of travel: positive = rising (spreading, being adopted), negative = falling (being rejected, fading). `+0.3` = 30% prevalent and gaining ground. `-0.3` = 30% prevalent and losing ground. The phase is emergent from the sign and magnitude — no separate phase field needed. `+0.95` is approaching fixation. `+1.0` is fixed. `-0.95` is the moment after the peak. `-0.05` is nearly silenced.

For reactivated conventions (alleles that were previously silenced and are now rising again), the positive sign alone can't distinguish first-envelope from second-envelope. A single boolean handles this: `reactivated: true` means the current positive trajectory is a second curve, carrying epigenetic history. The convention is quoting itself.

The algebra is available when precision is needed: `entrenchment(t) = e^(-0.4(t-1986)²) + 0.3·e^(-0.8(t-2018)²)` encodes the full lifecycle as a function of time — first hump (original adoption), second hump (reactivation at lower amplitude). But the working tool during analysis is the signed float evaluated at the song's production date. The analyst doesn't need to see the curve every time.

**Calculation sources** — the data that parameterizes the curves (when a convention emerged, peaked, was silenced, reactivated) — live in a separate reference file, populated and maintained by the Web Engine from cultural context: music journalism, academic studies, production histories, chart data, genre timelines. This is the fossil record. It's consulted when building or refreshing the curves, and when a conversation reveals a former premise was wrong — but not during routine analysis.

**The flywheel (11 Feb 2026):** Every Web Engine retrieval — even from a routine, mundane analysis — is a data point on convention timelines. Every song analyzed is a core sample from the fossil record. The curve-base gets denser and more accurate with every interaction, regardless of depth of inquiry. A routine analysis of a 2024 pop song that finds a gated snare confirms: the reactivation curve is still positive in pop at this date. That's a data point. At scale, this means the system's convention curves become empirically derived rather than estimated — the organism studies itself more accurately the more it's observed. The mundane feeds the profound.

The convention lifecycle model (Phases 1-9 above) is the Cultural Engine's core analytical framework. Given a song's production date and genre placement, the Cultural Engine evaluates the convention's entrenchment function at that point and returns the signed float. The sign and magnitude together tell the Interpretive Engine what the convention's presence MEANS.

### Activation Layer = Transcription Regulation

The three filters (genre markedness, thematic alignment, production attribution) are **transcription factor complexes**. They don't change the genetic material — they determine which genes are expressed (signal) and which are silent (water) in this specific cellular context. The Activation Layer IS the regulatory machinery that converts raw genotype into context-dependent expression.

### Interpretive Engine = Functional Genomics

Asks: what happens when these genes are expressed in this cellular context, in this listener, at this moment? The Interpretive Engine is where genotype + environment + regulation converge to produce phenotype. It's the test of whether the infrastructure works — whether the sequencing, the population genetics, and the regulatory modelling actually predict what the listener experiences.

The central equation: **Listener experience = Binary reading + Cultural context + (their interaction)**

This IS: **Phenotype = Genotype + Environment + (G×E interaction)**

### Percussion Module = Per-Gene Analysis

Per-element meters are **gene-level analysis within a chromosome**. Each percussive element (kick, snare, hat) is a gene with its own expression profile (IOI, cycle, anchor). The module reads individual genes within their chromosomal context.

### Feltness Module = Somatic Phenotyping

Maps the phenotypic output of gene expression onto the listener's body. The gesture model (onset → sustain → offset → silence) is a **protein's functional cycle** — the temporal shape of the product after translation. The polling model is the cell's metabolic cycle — how frequently the expression machinery checks for new input.

### The Conversation = Phenotype Observation

Where the phenotype is actually observed. The listener reports what they experience. This is the organism's phenotype — not the genotype (what's in the recording), not the transcriptome (what's being expressed), but the proteome (what functional products are actually operating in the cell). Somatic data is Tier 1 because the phenotype is the final arbiter.

## WHAT THIS FRAME ENABLES

### 1. Convention lifecycle analysis

Every convention detected in a song can now be placed on a population genetics trajectory. The Cultural Engine determines: what phase is this allele in? Is it a new mutation (innovation), a polymorphic variant (a live choice), a fixed allele (water), a housekeeping gene (generic), a negatively selected allele (dated), a silenced gene (suppressed), or a reactivated gene (quotation)? The answer changes what the convention's detection MEANS for the Interpretive Engine.

### 2. Linkage analysis

Conventions that co-occur on the same influential chromosomes are linked. They co-inherit even without functional relationship. The system can now ask: are these two conventions co-occurring because they work well together (functional), or because they were on the same influential songs (linkage)? Distinguishing these requires checking whether the correlation persists across territories that independently adopted one but not the other.

### 3. Force attribution

Did a convention fix through selection (it made songs chart-successful) or drift (the scene was small)? The trajectory shape differs: selection produces S-curves, drift produces random walks. The Cultural Engine can infer the force from the trajectory shape, weighted by territory population size.

### 4. Cross-territory translocation tracking

Convention spread between genres is intra-genomic translocation. The system can track which alleles have translocated between which territories, at what rate, via what vectors (which artists, which samples, which production techniques). This IS the answer to how genres influence each other — it's gene flow within a single organism.

### 5. Epigenetic history

A reactivated convention carries its full lifecycle as additional information. The system should flag: this allele was previously silenced in this territory. Its current expression is quotation, not naïve usage. The Interpretive Engine needs this to distinguish genuine innovation from retro reference.

## OPEN QUESTIONS (for the Conversation)

1. **What exactly are the chromosome territories?** We've said genres are territories. But genres are fuzzy, overlapping, contested. Chromosome territories in biology have measurable boundaries (TADs — topologically associated domains). What are the measurable boundaries of a genre-territory? The Prescriptive Genre Prints are a first attempt, but they're theoretical. The Descriptive Genre Prints might converge on empirical territory boundaries as n increases.

2. **~~What is Music's karyotype?~~** RESOLVED (11 Feb 2026). The karyotype is not a count — it's a **terrain**. A spectrogram turned flat into a heat map with peaks and valleys. Each peak is a chromosome territory (a genre). Height = chromosome density (how many songs cluster there). Ridges between peaks = lineage paths (evolutionary routes along which genetic material flowed between territories). Valleys = transition zones where genre boundaries gradient into each other. The terrain is continuous — no walls, only crossfades.

    The chromosome space is bounded by the physics of sound: ~20–20,000 cycles of amplitude within a decibel range, per second, across typical song duration, multiplied by polyphony. The chromosome is a waveform — a path through this space. The karyotype is the collection of all paths (songs) that have been drawn with intent, organised spatially by genetic similarity. The Descriptive Genre Prints build this terrain empirically — every song analyzed is a pin dropped on the map. At scale, the full topology emerges: where the peaks are, how they connect, where the boundaries gradient. See `karyotype-terrain.html` for visualisation.

3. **The artist as reproductive machinery.** The artist absorbs chromosomes, performs recombination, produces new chromosomes. They are the germline — the cells that create new genetic material. But they're also somatic — they participate in expression (listening, performing). In biology, the germline/soma distinction is hard in animals but blurry in plants (any cell can become reproductive). Music might be more plant than animal here. How formal does the artist's role need to be in the architecture?

4. **The environment is partly constructed by the organism.** Music shapes culture which shapes Music. This is **niche construction** — the organism modifies its own environment, which then selects on its own genome. Not a flaw in the model, but it makes prediction recursive.

5. **Ancient chromosomes.** If the genome isn't growing by adding new chromosomal types — if genres show different expressions of known chromosomes — then what are the ANCIENT chromosomes? The ur-songs? The fundamental song-functions that have existed across all human cultures? The lullaby, the work song, the lament, the celebration, the prayer? These might be the conserved chromosomal structures. New songs are allelic variants of these ancient types.
