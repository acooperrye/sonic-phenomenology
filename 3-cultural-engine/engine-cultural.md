# CULTURAL ENGINE
## Sonic Phenomenology — Component Spec

## PURPOSE

Maps the cultural tension field surrounding a song. Produces a structured account of what conventions the song inherits, which it obeys, and which it subverts — the prerequisite context without which bridge Types 6 (Excision) and 7 (Inversion) cannot be identified.

Runs parallel to the Web Engine in Phase B (receives the same artist/title/genre input). Can also be invoked as a subordinate pass after the Web Engine has committed genre, if the cultural context depends on genre-specific knowledge.

Produces inert descriptors — contextual facts without interpretation. The Interpretive Engine decides what's artistically significant.

Can be updated without touching any other component.

**Cross-references:**
- **fingerprint-registry.md** — universal catalogue of 64 sonic fingerprints (the atoms). Each convention in this engine references fingerprint IDs.
- **genre-fingerprint-map.md** — 58 genres mapped to fingerprint IDs (the molecules). Once genre is committed, this is the lookup table for expected fingerprints.

---

## THE PROBLEM THIS ENGINE SOLVES

Bridge Types 1-5 (Structure ↔ Theme) can be identified from audio + lyrics + thematic context. The Binary Engine measures structure. The Web Engine retrieves theme. Tension between them is computationally detectable.

Bridge Types 6-7 (Musical structure ↔ Musical semantics) CANNOT be identified from the song alone. They require knowledge of what the song is subverting — conventions that exist outside the audio file, in the accumulated history of the genre, the era, and the listener's biographical exposure. The Binary Engine can detect that a snare has become tonal (Circle Pit). It cannot detect that this is a violation of the convention that snares are rhythmic. That convention lives in cultural context, not in the waveform.

**Without this engine, the Interpretive Engine can only identify Types 1-5.**

---

## CORE CONCEPT: THE CONVENTION BANK

Every genre/era/scene establishes a set of conventions — default expectations about what music does structurally, who it addresses, what roles instruments play, how production relates to content. These conventions form a **tension bank**: accumulated structural norms that are available for violation.

The Cultural Context Engine's primary output is a structured Convention Bank for the song under analysis. This is what Types 6 and 7 subvert.

### Convention (the unit of the convention bank)

**DESIGN PRINCIPLE (Alex, 10 Feb 2026):** A convention is not a prose description that gets translated into a binary search instruction. The convention IS the binary fingerprint. The cultural engine doesn't tell the binary engine what to look for in natural language — it hands it fingerprint patterns ranked by likelihood for this genre. The convention and the detection instruction are the same object.

This means: Web Engine commits genre → Cultural Engine receives genre → genre maps to an ordered set of fingerprint references → each fingerprint defines both the convention (what's expected) and the detection shape (what to measure), with pass level, zoom level, and masking/subtractive analysis parameters.

```

                                        // -0.3 = declining convention. +1.0 = deeply entrenched, stable.

                                        // identical to an earlier phase but the semantic weight differs.

    bridge_type_if_found: 7
  }
}
```

### Example: Convention fingerprint for "gated snare"

```
{
  id: "era.80s_gated_snare",
  category: "production",
  domain: "1980s pop/rock",
  statement: "gated reverb on snare with hard cutoff",
  entrenchment: +0.15,     // POSITIVE but low: reactivating. Original lifecycle peaked at
                            // ~+0.9 in 1985, genericized by ~1992, silenced by ~1998.
                            // Currently rising again in synthwave/retrowave contexts (2015+)
                            // but at much lower amplitude than original peak.
                            // Sign = current direction of travel = rising (reactivation).
                            // Algebraic (original): e(t) ≈ 0.9·e^(-0.3(t-1986)²)
                            // Algebraic (reactivation): e(t) ≈ 0.15·(1 - e^(-0.2(t-2015)))
  reactivated: true,        // reappears in synthwave (2015+) but as quotation, not convention.
                            // Semantic weight differs from original — ironic/nostalgic, not default.
  scope: "era",
  genre_rank: 4,           // 4th most expected convention for 80s pop

    target_band: ["mid", "hi_mid"],

    expected_shape: {
      onset_ratio: { op: ">", val: 15 },
      decay_type: "hard_gate",
      decay_time_ms: { op: "<", val: 80 },
      crest_factor_db: { op: ">", val: 18 }
    },

      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "hit",
      masking: "hpss_percussive",
      min_section_duration_ms: 100,
      requires_roster: false            // gated snare is detectable without knowing context
    },

    violation_signature: null,          // gated snare isn't typically violated — it's a convention
                                        // that's either present or absent. Its absence from an 80s
                                        // track might be notable but isn't a bridge-type violation.
    violation_type_if_found: null,
    bridge_type_if_found: null
  }
}
```

### Genre → Convention ordering

The genre fingerprint in Shared Protocol gains an associated convention manifest:

```
GenreConventionManifest {
  genre_id:         string
  conventions:      ConventionRef[]     // ordered by likelihood

  // Each ref points to a convention + specifies genre-specific overrides
  ConventionRef {
    convention_id:  string              // "universal.drums_are_rhythmic"
    genre_rank:     int                 // position in the ordered list for this genre
    genre_override: object | null       // genre-specific parameter adjustments
                                        // e.g. breakcore might override onset_rate_hz threshold
                                        // because extreme onset rates ARE expected in breakcore
  }
}
```

This is the key mechanism: the same convention ("drums are rhythmic") can appear in multiple genre manifests with different rankings and overrides. In rock, it's rank 1 with standard thresholds. In breakcore, it's rank 1 but with the `onset_rate_hz` threshold raised — because breakcore expects extreme onset rates as a genre convention. Circle Pit violates it by pushing PAST even breakcore's raised threshold. The violation is measured relative to the genre's own adjusted expectations, not relative to universal defaults.

## UNIVERSAL CONVENTION BANK

The minimum set of conventions loaded for EVERY analysis, regardless of genre. These represent expectations so deeply internalized that virtually all music listeners hold them. All 10 are checked on every pass. Genre manifests override thresholds but never remove a universal convention — the convention is still present, just with adjusted parameters.

Conventions are numbered U1-U10. The first 6 have full fingerprint definitions (these are the ones most likely to trigger Type 6/7 bridge signals). U7-U10 have reference definitions and are pending full fingerprint specification.

### U1: universal.drums_are_rhythmic

*(Full fingerprint defined above as worked example. Reproduced here by reference.)*

Category: hierarchical. Entrenchment: 1.0. Scope: universal.
Detection: hi_mid band, HPSS balance, onset rate, crest factor.
Violation: HPSS inverts (drums become tonal through density). Bridge type 7 (Inversion).

### U2: universal.rhythm_heard_bass_felt

```
{
  id: "universal.rhythm_heard_bass_felt",
  category: "hierarchical",
  domain: "universal",
  statement: "percussion provides the consciously tracked beat; bass/sub-bass provides felt weight",
  entrenchment: +0.95,     // stable
  reactivated: false,
  scope: "universal",
  genre_rank: 2,

  fingerprint: {
    target_band: ["hi_mid", "sub_bass"],
    target_role: null,

    expected_shape: {
      // Hi-mid: the rhythmic reference. Discrete hits, consciously countable.
      onset_ratio: { op: ">", val: 4, band: "hi_mid" },
      hpss_balance: { op: ">", val: 0.5, band: "hi_mid" },
      crest_factor_db: { op: ">", val: 10, band: "hi_mid" },

      // Sub-bass: the weight system. Present, felt, but not the beat grid.
      onset_ratio: { op: "<", val: 25, band: "sub_bass" },
      band_energy_pct: { op: ">", val: 10, band: "sub_bass" },

      // CROSS-BAND: hi-mid onset ratio > sub-bass onset ratio
      // (the sharpest transients are in the "heard" band, not the "felt" band)
      cross_band: {
        comparison: "onset_ratio",
        rule: "hi_mid > sub_bass",
        description: "percussion attacks are sharper than bass attacks"
      }
    },

    detection: {
      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "section",
      masking: "isolate_band",
      min_section_duration_ms: 2000,
      requires_roster: false
    },

    violation_signature: {
      // Sub-bass becomes the primary rhythmic reference
      // Hi-mid loses discrete transient character
      cross_band: {
        comparison: "onset_ratio",
        rule: "sub_bass > hi_mid",
        description: "bass hits are sharper than drum hits — felt band carries the beat"
      },
      hpss_balance: { op: "<", val: 0.4, band: "hi_mid" },
    },

    violation_type_if_found: "inversion",
    bridge_type_if_found: 7
  }
}
```

Note on `cross_band`: Extension to the ConventionFingerprint struct for hierarchical conventions. These conventions are ABOUT relationships between frequency bands, not properties of a single band. The `cross_band` field specifies which measurement to compare across which bands. This is what makes Types 6 and 7 detectable — they are relational violations, not absolute ones. Circle Pit's sub-bass onset ratio (1.1x) is unremarkable on its own. It only becomes a violation when compared to the hi-mid onset character (which has become tonal).

### U3: universal.bass_provides_foundation

```
{
  id: "universal.bass_provides_foundation",
  category: "semantic",
  domain: "universal",
  statement: "bass/sub-bass provides harmonic foundation and felt weight beneath other elements",
  entrenchment: +0.9,      // stable
  reactivated: false,
  scope: "universal",
  genre_rank: 3,

  fingerprint: {
    target_band: ["sub_bass", "bass"],
    target_role: null,

    expected_shape: {
      band_energy_pct: { op: ">", val: 15 },     // sub+bass combined > 15% of total energy
      hpss_balance: { op: ">", val: 0.5 },        // mostly harmonic (pitched bass notes, not noise)
      pitch_range_hz: [20, 250],                    // bass content lives in the low end
      onset_ratio: { op: ">", val: 1.5 },          // has SOME attack (not pure drone)
    },

    detection: {
      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "song",
      masking: null,                                // measurable from full mix
      requires_roster: false
    },

    violation_signature: {
      band_energy_pct: { op: "<", val: 5 },        // bass essentially absent
      // OR: bass present but not harmonic (noise-bass, distortion-bass)
      hpss_balance: { op: "<", val: 0.3 },
    },

    violation_type_if_found: "excision",            // removing bass entirely = semantic excision
    bridge_type_if_found: 6
  }
}
```

Dictionary reference: PUTP sub+bass = 74%, Blade Runner = 76%, Circle Pit = 54%, Shout ~55%. All well above the 15% floor. A track with <5% combined bass would be violating a near-universal convention.

### U4: universal.sounds_decay_naturally

```
{
  id: "universal.sounds_decay_naturally",
  category: "structural",
  domain: "universal",
  statement: "sounds begin with attack and decay over time, following acoustic physics",
  entrenchment: +0.85,     // stable (physics-grounded, not culturally contingent)
  reactivated: false,
  scope: "universal",
  genre_rank: 4,

  fingerprint: {
    target_band: "full",
    target_role: null,

    expected_shape: {
      onset_ratio: { op: ">", val: 1.5 },          // attacks exist (energy arrives faster than it leaves)
      decay_type: "natural",                         // exponential decay, not hard gate or reverse
      envelope_stages: 1,                            // single attack-decay per event (not multi-stage)
    },

    detection: {
      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "hit",
      masking: "hpss_percussive",                   // check transients specifically
      min_section_duration_ms: 50,
      requires_roster: false
    },

    violation_signature: {
      onset_ratio: { op: "<", val: 1.0 },           // reversed sound (energy grows instead of decaying)
      decay_type: "reversed",
      // OR: multi-stage envelope that no acoustic object produces
      envelope_stages: { op: ">", val: 1 },
    },

    // Not necessarily a bridge — could just be production technique
    violation_type_if_found: "mutation",
    bridge_type_if_found: null                      // reversed sounds aren't automatically a bridge
  }
}
```

Note: This convention is weaker than U1-U3. Electronic music routinely violates natural decay (gated reverb, reversed cymbals, sidechain pumping). The entrenchment is lower (0.85) and violations don't signal bridge types on their own. BUT: this convention becomes structurally important in combination with others — SOPHIE's two-stage envelope (sub-bass snap + mid rubber bloom at +93ms) violates U4 in a way that's not just a production technique but a material statement. The multi-stage envelope is what makes the rubber texture. The violation is the material.

      hpss_balance: { op: "<", val: 0.5, band: "high" },

      // Cross-band: energy distribution follows standard spectral shape
      // (not a single number — this is the spectral centroid being in a "normal" range)

    detection: {
      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "song",

      hpss_balance: { op: "<", val: 0.3, band: "sub_bass" },  // bass has become noise
      hpss_balance: { op: ">", val: 0.7, band: "hi_mid" },    // percussion has become tonal
    },

    violation_type_if_found: "inversion",

  }
}
```

Dictionary reference: Circle Pit shows exactly this violation — hi_mid HPSS reads 70.8% harmonic (percussion has become tonal). The sub-bass remains harmonic (35-40Hz pitch center) so the violation is one-sided: hi-mid role has flipped, sub-bass role has held.

### U6: universal.dynamic_emphasis

```
{
  id: "universal.dynamic_emphasis",
  category: "structural",
  domain: "universal",
  statement: "louder moments carry structural emphasis; dynamics signal hierarchy",
  entrenchment: +0.75,     // stable but weakening slightly (loudness wars erode this)
  reactivated: false,
  scope: "universal",
  genre_rank: 6,

  fingerprint: {
    target_band: "full",
    target_role: null,

    expected_shape: {
      crest_factor_db: { op: ">", val: 6 },        // meaningful dynamic range exists
      // Spectral flux trajectory has peaks and valleys (section-level dynamics)
      // This is harder to express as a single operator — may need custom measurement
    },

    detection: {
      pass_level: "full",
      zoom_level: "song",
      masking: null,
      requires_roster: false
    },

    violation_signature: {
      crest_factor_db: { op: "<", val: 4 },         // brick-wall limited, no dynamic variation
      // Note: low crest factor is common in modern mastering (loudness wars)
      // and in genres like breakcore, noise, industrial.
      // This violation is NOT automatically a bridge — it's often just a production norm.
    },

    violation_type_if_found: null,                   // too common to be a bridge signal on its own
    bridge_type_if_found: null
  }
}
```

Dictionary reference: Circle Pit crest factor 3.1 (extreme limiting). Shout crest factor 16.1. PUTP somewhere between. Low crest factor is a genre convention for breakcore, not a violation — the breakcore manifest overrides this threshold.

### U7-U10 (reference definitions, pending full fingerprints)

```
U7: universal.temporal_regularity
  category: "structural"
  statement: "music has a detectable, stable pulse or beat grid"
  entrenchment: +0.8, reactivated: false
  detection: autocorrelation peak at a single tempo, stable across sections
  violation: arrhythmic, tempo unstable, no detectable pulse
  bridge_type_if_found: null (free time is a production choice, not typically a bridge)

U8: universal.vocals_are_foreground
  category: "hierarchical"
  statement: "when vocals are present, they occupy the lead/foreground position"
  entrenchment: +0.85 (conditional — only applies when vocals detected), reactivated: false
  detection: vocal band (200-4000Hz) harmonic content centered, higher relative energy
  violation: vocal pushed to background, treated as texture, spatially distant
  bridge_type_if_found: 6 (Excision — vocal's semantic role removed while voice persists)
  NOTE: SOPHIE's Lemonade shows partial violation — vocal recognized as human but NOT
  mapped to self, spatially above/away rather than foreground. Not full excision but
  partial. The vocal is present but doesn't address the listener.

U9: universal.stereo_center_priority
  category: "production"
  statement: "primary elements (vocal, kick, bass) are centered; support elements are wider"
  entrenchment: +0.7, reactivated: false
  detection: primary band M/S ratio low (<2), support band M/S ratio higher
  violation: center empty, primary elements pushed to extremes
  bridge_type_if_found: null (stereo experimentation is common, rarely a bridge)

U10: universal.structure_has_sections
  category: "structural"
  statement: "songs have identifiable sections with transitions between them"
  entrenchment: +0.7, reactivated: false
  detection: spectral flux shows section-level changes, energy trajectory has peaks/valleys
  violation: completely uniform texture, no section boundaries, relentless consistency
  bridge_type_if_found: null (drone, ambient, and noise genres routinely omit sections)

## CONVENTION BANK CATEGORIES (DETAILED)

### 1. Structural conventions
What songs in this genre typically do architecturally.

Examples:
- "Songs have verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structure"
- "Tracks build via additive layering toward a peak/drop"
- "Songs are typically 3-5 minutes long"
- "Tempo is typically 120-140 BPM"
- "Time signature is 4/4"

### 2. Semantic conventions
What instruments/sounds/techniques typically MEAN in this genre.

Examples:
- "Drums provide rhythmic structure"
- "Bass provides harmonic foundation and felt weight"
- "Vocal carries melody and lyrical content"
- "A drop signifies release of built tension"
- "Gated reverb signifies 1980s production"

### 3. Hierarchical conventions
What the expected perceptual hierarchy is — what you hear vs feel, what's foreground vs background.

Examples:
- "Percussion is rhythmic, bass is felt, melody is heard"
- "Vocal is foreground, instruments are accompaniment"
- "Sub-bass is felt, not consciously tracked"
- "Hi-hats provide subdivisions, not melodic content"

**THIS IS WHERE TYPES 6 AND 7 OPERATE.** Excision removes a semantic layer. Inversion flips a hierarchical relationship. Both require this category to be populated for detection.

### 4. Address conventions
How the music relates to the listener.

Examples:
- "Pop music addresses the listener through vocal performance"
- "Dance music addresses the listener through bodily rhythm"
- "Ambient music creates an environment the listener inhabits"
- "Breakcore does not address the listener — listener must orient themselves"

### 5. Production conventions
How the music is expected to sound and be made.

Examples:
- "Electronic music uses synthesized rather than recorded sound sources"
- "Lo-fi production signifies authenticity"
- "Mastering loudness is maximized in this genre"
- "Breakcore uses sample-based production with heavy editing"

## WORKFLOW

### Phase B (parallel with Web Engine):

```
Step 1: LINEAGE RETRIEVAL
  Input: artist, genre, year
  Action: Web search for genre ancestry, artist influences, scene context
  Output: lineage, scene_context, era_placement
  Sources: Wikipedia, RYM, AllMusic, academic genre studies, artist interviews

Step 2: CONVENTION BANK ASSEMBLY
  Input: committed genre, lineage, era
  Action: Build convention bank from:
    a) Universal conventions (always present, scope: "universal")
    b) Genre-specific conventions (from genre ancestry chain)
    c) Era-specific conventions (from era placement)
    d) Scene-specific conventions (from scene context, if available)
  Output: convention_bank (all five categories populated)
  Sources: Genre studies, production manuals, critical discourse

Step 3: CONVENTION CONFIDENCE CHECK
  Input: convention_bank, web_context (from Web Engine)
  Action: Cross-reference conventions against known production/arrangement data
  Output: convention_bank with confidence scores
  Note: Some conventions may be uncertain until Binary Engine data arrives
```

### Post-Binary (after full analysis available):

```
Step 4: VIOLATION DETECTION
  Input: convention_bank, binary structural descriptor, web context
  Action: Compare each convention's structural_prediction against actual measurements
  Output: violations[] — which conventions are being violated, how, and to what degree

Step 5: PRIOR REQUIREMENT MAPPING
  Input: violations[]
  Action: For each violation, determine what the listener needs to know for it to register
  Output: prior_requirements[] — biographical bridge requirements

Step 6: BRIDGE TYPE SIGNALING
  Input: violations[], prior_requirements[]
  Action: Flag violations that signal Type 6 (Excision) or Type 7 (Inversion)
  Output: Updated violations with bridge_type_signal
  Note: Does NOT determine bridge type — passes signals to Interpretive Engine
```

## RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING ENGINES

### Reads from:
- **Web Engine**: genre commitment, thematic vector, production method, credits
- **Binary Engine**: structural descriptor (post-full-pass, for violation detection)
- **Shared Protocol**: genre baselines, element registry

### Produces for:
- **Interpretive Engine**: convention bank, violations, prior requirements, bridge type signals
- **Activation Layer**: convention context for interpreting roster deviations
  - A roster deviation (from Binary Engine) + convention context (from Cultural Engine) = meaningful finding
  - Example: Binary flags "percussive-high role has become harmonic" (roster deviation: spectral_fusion). Cultural Engine provides convention "snare drums are rhythmic" (entrenchment: 1.0). Together: this is a hierarchical inversion with near-universal prior requirement.

### Does NOT know:
- Raw audio measurements (only receives structured Binary Engine output)
- How to interpret violations artistically (that's the Interpretive Engine's job)

## EXAMPLE: CIRCLE PIT (full fingerprint pass)

**Song**: Venetian Snares — Circle Pit (Detrimentalist, 2008)
**Genre committed**: breakcore (Phase A)
**Manifest loaded**: breakcore GenreConventionManifest (above)

### Step 1: Convention bank assembly

Breakcore manifest loads 10 universal conventions (with overrides) and 5 genre-specific conventions. Ordered by genre_rank:

```

### Step 2: Binary data (from full analysis)

```

### Step 3: Violation detection (fingerprint comparison)

```
VIOLATION 1: universal.drums_are_rhythmic
─────────────────────────────────────────
  Convention fingerprint (breakcore-adjusted):
    expected:   hpss_balance > 0.5, onset_rate_hz < 12, crest_factor > 15
    measured:   hpss_balance = 0.292, onset_rate ~5.7/sec (individual), crest ~11
    violation:  hpss_balance < 0.4 → TRIGGERED (0.292 < 0.4)
               onset_rate_hz > 12 → NOT triggered for individual hits
               BUT composite percussion rate pushes into quasi-harmonic territory
               HPSS inversion is the definitive signal: drums are 70.8% HARMONIC

  Fingerprint match: violation_signature.hpss_balance < 0.4 → TRUE
  Violation type: inversion
  Bridge type signal: 7

  Binary evidence: HPSS reads 70.8% harmonic in hi-mid band. Amen snare hits at
    ~5.7/sec individually, but composite break density (all percussion) crosses the
    threshold where repetition rate enters tonal territory. The percussion has BECOME
    a harmonic texture — a "single somewhat detuned keyboard note" (Alex).

  Cultural evidence: Violates most deeply entrenched musical convention (entrenchment 1.0).
    Even the breakcore-adjusted threshold (onset_rate < 12) is designed to accommodate
    extreme speed — this track still violates via the HPSS route rather than the pure
    rate route. The drums didn't just get fast. They changed state.

  Confidence: 0.95


VIOLATION 2: universal.rhythm_heard_bass_felt
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Convention fingerprint (breakcore-adjusted):
    expected:   cross_band.rule = "hi_mid onset_ratio >= sub_bass onset_ratio"
                hi_mid band = percussive primary, sub_bass band = felt weight
    measured:   hi_mid has LOST percussive identity (see Violation 1)
                sub_bass onset_ratio = 1.1x (low, not sharp)
                BUT sub-bass is the ONLY remaining legible rhythmic structure
    violation:  cross_band rule INVERTED: sub-bass carries the beat, hi-mid is texture

  Fingerprint match: violation_signature.cross_band.rule = "sub_bass > hi_mid" → TRUE
    (sub-bass is the rhythmic reference because hi-mid has fused into drone)
  Violation type: inversion
  Bridge type signal: 7

  Binary evidence: Sub-bass onset correlation with hi-mid = 0.481 (partially aligned).
    Sub-bass envelope begins rising before hi-mid peak. Sub-bass peak at +2.3ms after
    hi-mid transient. Sub-bass provides the only felt beat grid at 172 BPM (~2.9Hz).
    Onset ratio 1.1x means the sub-bass doesn't hit hard — it SWAYS. But it's the only
    thing swaying at a trackable rate. Everything else is drone.

  Cultural evidence: Violates near-universal hierarchical convention (entrenchment 0.95).
    "You hear the beat and feel the bass" becomes "you hear the drone and feel the beat."
    The breakcore manifest's softened cross_band rule (>= rather than >) makes no
    difference here — the inversion is total, not marginal.

  Confidence: 0.90


VIOLATION 3: universal.frequency_roles_fixed
────────────────────────────────────────────
  Convention fingerprint:
    expected:   hi-mid hpss_balance > 0.4 (percussive character)
    measured:   hi-mid hpss_balance = 0.292
    violation:  hi-mid HPSS < 0.3 → approaching violation threshold

  This is CORRELATED with Violation 1 but distinct: Violation 1 says "drums aren't
  rhythmic." Violation 3 says "the hi-mid frequency band has changed its role."
  The convention being violated is about frequency assignment, not instrument function.

  Fingerprint match: violation_signature.hpss_balance > 0.7 (band: hi_mid) → PARTIAL
    (0.708 harmonic, just above the 0.7 threshold)
  Violation type: inversion
  Bridge type signal: 7 (correlated with Violation 1)

  Confidence: 0.85 (partially redundant with V1)


NO VIOLATION: breakcore.sub_bass_shadow
───────────────────────────────────────
  Convention fingerprint:
    expected:   sub-bass onset_ratio < 3, correlation > 0.3, delay < 5ms
    measured:   onset_ratio 1.1x ✓, correlation 0.481 ✓, delay ~2.3ms ✓
    result:     CONVENTION MET — the shadow bass IS a breakcore production technique.
                It's not a violation. It's the mechanism by which Violations 1 and 2 work.
                The shadow provides the rhythmic replacement that lets percussion become drone.

  This is significant: the shadow bass is the ENABLER of the inversions, not itself a
  violation. Without it, Circle Pit would be noise (no rhythmic reference at all).
  With it, Circle Pit is a hierarchical inversion (the rhythm is felt, not heard).
```

### Step 4: Prior requirements

```
Violation 1 priors:
  requirement: "listener must know that drums provide rhythmic structure"
  population_coverage: 0.95
  minimum_exposure: "any popular music"
  degrades_without_prior: true
  // Without this prior, the 70.8% harmonic HPSS is just "a sound."
  // With it, it's "drums doing something drums don't do."

Violation 2 priors:
  requirement: "listener must know that you hear beats and feel bass"
  population_coverage: 0.90
  minimum_exposure: "any bass-heavy music (hip-hop, electronic, club)"
  degrades_without_prior: true
  // Without bass-heavy music experience, the sub-bass shadow as rhythmic
  // reference is invisible — the listener has no expectation to invert.

Violation 3 priors:
  requirement: "listener must know that high frequencies carry percussion"
  population_coverage: 0.85
  minimum_exposure: "any produced music"
  degrades_without_prior: true
  // Correlated with Violation 1 — same biographical bridge, different angle.
```

### Step 5: Bridge type signaling

```
BRIDGE SIGNAL: TYPE 7 (INVERSION) — HIGH CONFIDENCE

Three correlated violations all signaling Type 7:
  - V1: drums → tonal (instrument function swap)
  - V2: heard/felt hierarchy → felt/heard (perceptual hierarchy swap)
  - V3: hi-mid role → harmonic (frequency assignment swap)

All three require near-universal priors (population coverage 0.85-0.95).
All three degrade without prior (biographical bridges).

COMPOUND EFFECT: These violations are not independent — they are three faces
of one structural inversion. V1 causes V3 (drums becoming tonal changes the
hi-mid band's role). V1+V3 cause V2 (if percussion is no longer rhythmic,
something else must be, and the sub-bass shadow is the only candidate).
The Interpretive Engine should interpret these as a single compound inversion,
not three separate violations.

ENABLER: breakcore.sub_bass_shadow (convention MET) provides the structural
mechanism that makes the inversion listenable rather than chaotic. Without the
shadow, the inversions would produce formless noise. With it, they produce a
track where the beat has merely moved — from ears to chest, from hi-mid to
sub-bass, from heard to felt.

SOMATIC CONFIRMATION (from dictionary, correspondence #15):
  - Fever dream → rollercoaster cognitive flip
  - Sub-bass at 172 BPM ≈ elevated heartbeat → internal misattribution
  - "Bit like a circle pit" — continuous rotation, individual become collective
  → Interpretive Engine receives these as Tier 1 (somatic) evidence for Type 7
```

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. ~~**Convention bank completeness.** How many conventions constitute a "complete enough" bank for a given genre? Is there a minimum set of universal conventions that every analysis starts with?~~ **ANSWERED (10 Feb 2026):** 10 universal conventions (U1-U10) form the minimum set. 6 have full fingerprint definitions; 4 have reference definitions. Every analysis loads all 10. Genre manifests add genre-specific conventions and override universal thresholds. The breakcore manifest adds 5 genre-specific conventions on top of the 10 universals, for 15 total. This appears sufficient for Type 6/7 detection based on the Circle Pit validation.

2. **Convention discovery.** Some conventions are obvious (drums = rhythm). Others are subtle (gated reverb = 80s). How does the engine discover genre-specific conventions it doesn't already know? Web search for "conventions of [genre]" is unreliable. Academic genre studies are better but sparse.

3. **Entrenchment measurement.** How to quantify how deeply a convention is held? Population surveys don't exist. Proxy: how many genres share this convention? If it appears in the ancestry chain of 5+ genres, entrenchment is high.

4. **Cross-cultural conventions.** The current model assumes Western popular music conventions. Non-Western music has different hierarchical, semantic, and structural conventions. The engine needs to be aware of which conventions are culturally bounded. "Drums = rhythm" is probably near-universal. "Verse-chorus structure" is not.

5. ~~**Convention evolution.** Conventions change over time. The 808 was once unusual; now it's a convention. Autotune was once a violation; now it's expected. The convention bank needs to be era-aware — what was a violation in 2005 may be a convention by 2025. Timestamp all conventions.~~ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (11 Feb 2026):** The Genomic Frame (`genomic-frame.md`) provides the formal model for convention evolution — a 9-phase lifecycle mapped from population genetics (Mutation → Transposition → Polymorphism → Fixation → Selective Sweep → Genericization → Negative Selection → Epigenetic Silencing → Reactivation). The `entrenchment` field is now a signed float: magnitude = allele frequency, sign = direction of travel (+rising, -falling). Algebraic lifecycle curves (e.g. `e(t) = 0.9·e^(-0.3(t-1986)²)` for gated reverb) are available for precision. The `reactivated` boolean flags conventions that have returned from silencing (carrying different semantic weight). **Remaining:** curve parameterization sources need documenting (Web Engine retrieval as flywheel data), and era-awareness needs formalizing as a lookup function that evaluates `e(t)` at the song's release year.

6. **Interaction with somatic dictionary.** The somatic dictionary contains correspondences that are essentially felt conventions — "sub-bass at this onset ratio = punch," "sustained sub-bass = atmosphere." These are calibrated to Alex, not universal. Should the Cultural Engine have access to the somatic dictionary as a source of listener-specific conventions?

7. **Multiple simultaneous violations.** Circle Pit violates at least two conventions simultaneously (drums→tonal, heard/felt inversion). Does the interaction between violations compound the bridge effect, or does each operate independently? SOPHIE similarly has multiple simultaneous operations (referent excision + vocal non-address + synthetic materiality). The Interpretive Engine probably handles this, but the Cultural Engine should flag when multiple violations interact.

## RELATIONSHIP TO BRIDGE TAXONOMY

| Bridge type | Tension source | Engine that detects it |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1. Concealment | Structure ↔ Theme | Binary + Web |
| 2. Compensation | Structure ↔ Theme | Binary + Web |
| 3. Contradiction | Structure ↔ Theme | Binary + Web |
| 4. Refusal | Structure ↔ Theme | Binary + Web |
| 5. Conceit | Structure ↔ Theme | Binary + Web |
| 6. Excision | Musical structure ↔ Musical semantics | Binary + Web + **Cultural** |
| 7. Inversion | Musical structure ↔ Musical semantics | Binary + Web + **Cultural** |

Types 1-5: Binary measures structure, Web provides theme. Tension is between them.
Types 6-7: Binary measures structure, Cultural provides the conventions being violated. Tension is between what IS and what the listener EXPECTS.

**The Cultural Engine is the reason the bridge taxonomy can grow past five.**

## TUNABLE PARAMETERS

All independent of other engine versions. These are the knobs this engine owns.

### Convention bank assembly

| Parameter | Current value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Universal convention floor | 10 | Minimum number of universal conventions loaded for every analysis (U1–U10) |
| Genre rank cutoff | 15 | Maximum total conventions per song (universals + overrides + genre-specific). Beyond this, retention degrades and Type 6/7 detection gets noisy. |
| Era window | ±5 years | Range around release year used to select era-specific conventions and evaluate entrenchment lifecycle curves |
| Scene specificity threshold | 0.6 | Minimum confidence required for a scene context to add scene-scoped conventions |

### Entrenchment evaluation

| Parameter | Current value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Entrenchment "deep" threshold | ≥ 0.7 | Conventions above this are treated as foundational; violations weighted heavily |
| Entrenchment "emerging" threshold | 0.2 ≤ e < 0.5 | Conventions still establishing; violations carry less weight |
| Entrenchment "declining" sign threshold | e < 0 | Convention is in decline. Adherence is the marked move, not violation. |
| Reactivated convention semantic discount | 0.6 | Multiplier applied when `reactivated: true` — convention is back but carries ironic/quotational weight, not its original force |

### Violation detection

| Parameter | Current value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Violation threshold (signed deviation) | ≥ 0.5 | A convention is violated when measured value diverges from `expected_shape` by this much (in the convention's own units). Below: recorded as "tension," not flagged. |
| Compound violation correlation threshold | 0.7 | When N correlated violations all signal the same bridge type, they're emitted as a single compound violation |
| Prior requirement population floor | 0.4 | Minimum population coverage for a prior to be flagged as "biographical bridge" rather than "specialist bridge" |

### Bridge signaling

| Parameter | Current value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Type 6/7 confidence floor | 0.6 | Minimum confidence to signal Type 6 (Excision) or Type 7 (Inversion) to Interpretive Engine. Below: logged but not flagged. |
| Multi-violation compound threshold | 3+ | Number of correlated violations required to emit a "compound inversion" rather than independent violations |

### Future: per-genre tuning

Different genres may need different entrenchment sensitivity. A genre with deep universal adherence (e.g., classical) may need a higher violation threshold than one built on subversion (e.g., breakcore, hyperpop). The Cultural Engine can develop genre-specific parameter sets as the convention bank grows, without requiring changes to any other engine.

## READS FROM SHARED PROTOCOL
- `fingerprint-registry.md` — the 64 sonic fingerprints. Each convention references fingerprint IDs.
- `genre-fingerprint-map.md` — 58 genres mapped to fingerprint IDs. Once genre is committed, this is the lookup table for expected fingerprints.
- `genre-baselines.md` — per-genre center scores. Identifies which deviations are conventionally tolerated vs marked.
- `genomic-frame.md` — the 9-phase convention lifecycle model. Used to evaluate entrenchment curves over time.
- Element Registry (from `shared-protocol.md`) — fingerprint targeting

## READS FROM DICTIONARY
- Existing dictionary entries (`../dictionary/entries.md`) — precedent for how previously analyzed songs handled the same conventions

## READS FROM WEB ENGINE (Phase B output)
- `committed_genre` — selects the genre manifest to load
- `production` — credits, era conventions, notable techniques. Informs convention confidence and provides evidence for production-category conventions.
- `era_conventions` — era-specific conventions from the era placement

## READS FROM BINARY ENGINE (post-Phase B)
- `StructuralDescriptor` — the structural measurements that violations are detected against

## DOES NOT KNOW
- How to interpret violations artistically (Interpretive Engine's job)
- The somatic dictionary's correspondences (Alex-calibrated, belongs to Interpretive)
- The thematic vector (Web Engine output; Cultural reads `production` and `era_conventions`, not lyrics-derived themes)
- Whether a violation is meaningful — only that it exists, what convention it violates, and what prior the listener needs to register it

---

## THE KEY INSIGHT

The Cultural Engine exists because some tensions live outside the audio file.

The Binary Engine can detect that a snare has become tonal. It cannot detect that this is a *violation* of the convention that snares are rhythmic. That convention lives in the listener's accumulated exposure to popular music. The Binary Engine measures what IS. The Cultural Engine remembers what's EXPECTED. The interference pattern between them is where Types 6 (Excision) and 7 (Inversion) become detectable.

Without this engine, the Interpretive Engine has a five-type taxonomy. With it, the taxonomy can grow indefinitely — every new convention discovered is a new axis on which structural violations can register.

The convention is not a prose description. The convention IS the binary fingerprint. The detection instruction and the cultural fact are the same object — which is what makes this engine implementable rather than philosophical.
